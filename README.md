== Welcome to the Ada Crypto Library (ACL) aka libadacrypt

This library is an ongoing project that provides the Ada community to
strong cryptography primitives and schemes, focused to ensure
data confidentiality and data integrity. 


### Implemented Features
Symmetric Cryptography
---
 - Blockciphers: AES, Twofish, 3DES, Serpent
 - Modes of Operation : BPS, CFB, Ctr, OFB 
 - Tweakable Blockcipher Modes:  CMT, XT
 - Hash functions: SHA-1 (broken), SHA-256, (SHA-384), SHA-512, Whirlpool
 - MACs: RMAC, HMAC, CMAC
 - Authenticated Encryption schemes: OCB, SIV and McOE

Big (unsigned) number library
---
- Primary cyclic group arithmetic  (Z_p)
- Binary Field arithmetic support.
    - Elliptic Curve arithmetic
    - Supersingular Elliptic Curves Over Binary Fields  (SS-BF)
    - Non-Supersingular Elliptic Curves Over Binary Fields (NSS-BF)
     - Elliptic Curves Over Z_p (EC-Z_P)

Asymmetric Cryptography
---
  - Probabilistic primality testing
  - DSA signature scheme
  - OEAP-RSA 
  - ECDSA, ECDH

Nonce Generator Support: Random, Counter, Mixed

=== Getting started

### Prerequisites 
 * GNAT-4.6
 * GNU Make 3.81 or newer
 * gcov 4.7.1 or newer (optional for testing only)
 * lcov 1.9 or newer   (optional for testing only)


To build and test:
   make
   make acltest
   cd test  
   ./test-tests
	

To generate LCOV code coverage report (location: test/coverage/):
   make gcov
   cd test  
   ./test-tests
   make lcov


### To build the PDF documentation (location: doc/):
    make docu
